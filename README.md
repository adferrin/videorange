## `Welcome to Night Owl`

Night Owl is the brainchild of three General Assembly Students Aaron Rascon, Brian Kelly, and Austin Ferrin. In the time of Covid we wanted to be able to bring people together on a purly social platform away from work video calls and madding family group chats you never wanted to be a part of. Night Owl is an App that allows you and your friends to be able to watch anything on Youtube and chat with eachother in real time. It has a retro feel in nature and is here for you endless viewing needs.

### `Planning`

Night Owl started their planning using <a href="https://trello.com/b/tb68wuwn/youtube-react">Trello</a> to get the main goals down. Also involved in the planning stage were some rough wire frames from Lucid Chats to find placement of components and flow.

### `Unsolved Problems`

We were not able to display a list of all the people involved in the chat in real time, however we were able to declare in the chat when someone new entered and who was sending what messages using their usernames.
